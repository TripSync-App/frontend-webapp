# TripSync
A collaborative travel app built to streamline travel-planning processes. 

## User Management
Users may create accounts that they can use to connect with their fellow travelers. Users can change their profile pictures, names, and can leave teams they have joined. 
After reaching the app, if the user does not currently have an account/are not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page to create an account or login.

### User Profile Page

## Team Management
Users may make "teams" which are a collection of users. From these teams, users will have the ability to pick members to join vacations later. Management features include: creating teams, deleting teams, sharing invite links.

## Main Page
This is where users will start their journeys. On the page, they will be greeted with a set of cards representing their vacations. By clicking on a card, a user will be transported to the respective vacation page.
Users also have the ability to create vacations from this page, preview the vacation (which will give a small bit of information about the vacation), and share the link to the vacation page.

## Vacation Planning
This page allows users to view a planned vacation. This will allow users to view the members which are going on the vacation, create and view discussions, and export information from the discussions to be used in a Calendar app.

## Discussions
Discussions allow users to send messages between each other about a topic created by the admin of the team. Once a plan has been made, the admin can choose to finalize the discussion, which will save the location, time, and date of the event, to be exported later. 
Finalized discussions will stop users from being able to send messages, to prevent confusion about the discussion.
